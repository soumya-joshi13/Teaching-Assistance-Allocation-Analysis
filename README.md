# Teaching-Assistance-Allocation-Analysis
Analysis of teaching assistance allocation data to support effective academic resource planning and decision-making.

## Business Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze teaching assistance data and support effective allocation of teaching resources. The insights aim to improve academic planning, workload balance, and operational efficiency.

## Problem Statement
Educational institutions must allocate teaching assistants efficiently to ensure quality instruction while managing limited resources. Poor allocation can lead to overburdened staff or underutilized capacity.

## Dataset Overview
- Teaching assistance and academic workload data
- Target focus: Optimal allocation of teaching resources
- Features include course load, assistance requirements, and related attributes

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Methodology
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory analysis of workload and assistance requirements
- Identification of allocation patterns and imbalances
- Business interpretation of findings

## Key Insights
- Certain courses or departments require disproportionately higher assistance
- Resource imbalance can be identified through workload patterns
- Data-driven allocation can improve efficiency and fairness

## Business Use Cases
- Academic resource planning
- Teaching assistant workload optimization
- Department-level decision support

## Project Artifacts
- Python Notebook: `python/Teaching Assistance.ipynb`
- Final Report: `reports/Teaching_Assistance_Final_Report.pdf`

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how analytical insights can support effective academic resource allocation and operational decision-making.
